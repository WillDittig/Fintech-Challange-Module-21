# Fintech-Challange-Module-21
(Mars Coin) 
Project overview: 
The purpose of this project was to create a new crypotcurrency called Kasei Coin. 
The kasei coin created using the Solidity programming language in this project is a ERC20 fungible token. 
The second part of this project was to make a crowdsale available to the people of Mars.

This first step was to create the original Kasei Coin which consited of the following lines in Solidity

Once the Kasei Coin contract was complete, the Crowdsale constract was created. Here are the lines of code used to create the crowdsale contract

After the the crowdsale contract was completed the kaseicoin can now be shared amongst users. The following screenshot shows an address on Metmask sharing 300000 kasei coin to another user with a gas fee of 0.05 eth, proving that the transaction went through.
